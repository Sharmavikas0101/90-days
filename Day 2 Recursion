Day 2: 
 Practise on Recursion:
 
 How to find greatest common divisor of two number using  recursion ?
 
def gcd(a,b):
    assert int(a)==a and int(b)==b and a>0 and b>0 ," Parameters should be postive integer"
    if a>0 and b>0:
        return gcd(b,a%b)
    elif b==0:
        return a
print(gcd(48,18))
